1. the procedure of using our trained model.
Firstly, the .py file should be run in the relative path. 
secondly, the predicted images should be put in the “testdata” directory.
finally, the result will be saved in the "res_csv" directory.

2. the train data
the trained images is so large that it is difficult to save in the github. Therefere, we keep all the images in a public cloud service. Users can download them from  https://pan.baidu.com/s/15imtamJecd7G_jPmKsPOsw?pwd=hous. passport: hous.
Besides, we provide excel files that record the human annotated scores to the corresponding images. 

3. h5 model
The h5 is too large. It is also upload to https://pan.baidu.com/s/15imtamJecd7G_jPmKsPOsw?pwd=hous. Users should download it and put it in the "model" directory.
